Excellent Care That’s Here for Good
Scripps Health is San Diego’s trusted leader for quality health care
Each day at Scripps, we put the vision of our founders — Ellen Browning Scripps and Mother Mary Michael Cummings — into action, dedicating ourselves to quality, safe, cost-efficient, socially 
responsible health care for everyone we serve. We keep that vision at the forefront as we care for patients, engage in clinical research and ultimately improve community health.  

With Scripps, you get an ally. A friend. A partner who believes in the healthiest version of you. And we do everything within our power to get you there and keep you there.   

We do all of this in a supportive, collaborative and caring environment. We do this to make a positive, measurable difference in the health of our patients and people throughout Southern 
California. We do this to ensure you and your family have access to the best possible care when and where you need it — at every stage in your life. We do this because it is a calling, our 
mission and our promise to you. We’re here for you. We’re here for good.  

“The most important and beautiful gift ...
one human being can give to another is, in some way, to make life a little better to live.” — Ellen Browning Scripps, Founder, 1924
